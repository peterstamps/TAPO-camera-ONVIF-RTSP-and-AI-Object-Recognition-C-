How to make a Mask .png file for your Camera stream with GIMP?

You can probably also use other tools, but this explanation is using GIMP.
Follow these steps assuming you have already configured and use the program once:
1. In mycMotDetRec_config.ini set parameter: show_display_window_not_resized = Yes 
2. Run ./mycMotDetRec
3. When the window with title "Motion Detection Original Format" opens use CRTL-S to 
save a picture from the camera's orginal stream. Save it with e.g. my_mask.png in 
the directory where mycMotDetRec is located. Quit program mycMotDetRec.
4. Start GIMP and open the just created file my_mask.png in GIMP
5. Click on the icon of the free select tool (lasso) and draw lines around those area's that should
be out-of-scope with regard to motion detection. Examples are trees, waving plants, streets with lot of traffic 
and so on. Close the area by return to the starting point. 
6. Select a Black Foregroud color and then Click on Bucket Fill tool icon and fill the area you created in previous step.
That area will become fully black!
7. Repeat step 5 and 6 for every other area you wish to be out of scope for motion detection.
8. Once done Click on Menu >Select >None followed by >Menu >Select >All. All object must be selected!
9. Click on Menu >Image >Flatten Image (repeat when needed) till one single layer exists
10. Click on Menu >Colors >Thresholds (down in list). Set in the popup window in the middle left the number on 1.
11. The non black area's will become white. Maybe a few spots are still left. You can brush black/darkgray spots away if you wish.
12. Remember White areas will become Transparent, Black areas are NON-Transparent (=not sensitive for motion detection)
13. Save now my_mask.png
14. In mycMotDetRec_config.ini set parameter: mask_path = ./my_mask.png and save. Done!
15. Run again ./mycMotDetRec
